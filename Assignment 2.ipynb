    "Hey Anirban, congrats on your upcoming job and on graduating from UCSC. I've been quite busy since we came back from Ohio trying to catch up on everything post capstone exam and haven't had the time to work very diligently on this assignment. I haven't gotten anything to work yet. I'm focusing my efforts towards the final assignment and my other final exams. I'm sorry I missed the last class of the quarter, I was told we didn't have section, but I enjoyed learning about python from you and hope I can use some of this knowledge in the future. "
